"""Build and police a test environment that is the *shipped* dependency set.

`requirements_prod.lock` is the graph the release image installs with
`--require-hashes`. CI's test matrix installs `requirements_dev.txt` instead —
`-r requirements_base.txt` plus dev tools, every entry a `>=` floor — so it
exercises whatever resolves newest on the day it runs. The two sets are not the
same, and the shipped one was the one never executed.

This script supports the `test-shipped-lock` job:

  --emit-constraints PATH
      Write `name==version` for every pin in the lock, so test tooling can be
      installed *on top of* the shipped set without dragging any of it forward.

  --verify
      Assert every lock pin is installed at exactly its locked version. Without
      this, `pip install pytest` quietly upgrading a runtime package would put
      the job back to testing a set that is not the one that ships — the very
      defect the job exists to close, reintroduced by the job itself.

  --check-portable [LOCK ...]
      Refuse a lock (the shipped one unless others are named) that only
      resolves where it was generated. `pip-compile`
      resolves for the host it runs on and records that host's package
      sources, so a lock regenerated on a Windows workstation, or beside a
      sibling checkout, still installs on Linux and passes every other check
      here while shipping what it should not. Runs first in the job.
