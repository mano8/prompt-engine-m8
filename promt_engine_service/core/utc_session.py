"""Pin every PostgreSQL session this service opens to UTC.

sqlmodel ``0.0.46`` maps a plain ``datetime`` field to ``UTCDateTime``, which
binds an *aware* UTC value. Databases created under the previous mapping hold
``timestamp without time zone`` columns, and PostgreSQL casts an aware value
into such a column **in the session ``TimeZone``** — so on a server whose zone
is not UTC every new timestamp would be stored shifted by the offset, while
rows written before the upgrade were not (workspace finding ``G23``).

With the session pinned to UTC that cast is a no-op on every server, and the
one-time ``timestamp`` → ``timestamptz`` ALTER a later autogenerate emits reads
existing rows as the UTC they are. Other dialects bind the UTC wall clock
unchanged, so they are left alone. Applied to the service engine in
``core/deps.py`` and to Alembic's engine in ``alembic/env.py``.
