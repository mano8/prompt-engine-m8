"""Auth event-stream wiring for promt_engine_service.

Best-effort cache eviction accelerator — the JTI blacklist (fa-auth) remains
the authority.  A missed or replayed event is safe: the handler is idempotent
and the worst outcome is one extra HTTP round-trip to fa-auth.

Dispatch is delegated to ``AuthDeps.handle_auth_event`` / ``AuthDeps.flush_cache``
rather than re-derived here: the v2 generation watermark, ``event_id`` dedup and
hyphen/dot ``event_type`` normalization rules (§3.5.2) live in exactly one place
(``fastapi_m8``), and this service must not re-implement them.
